# Request Review

Once an Object is registered and simulation is run, it can be sent for review and approval for further use in the platform

??? info
When the mode **Publish Drafts** is enabled, draft can be used by other objects prior to being approved. Otherwise, only approved objects can be used as inputs to other objects. By default, a **simulation must be appended to the request for approval**. This requirement can be changed at installation time or by the Tech support team."
