Once a pipeline is registered on the GGX platform, it can be [evaluated and approved](../evaluate-and-approve/index.md) within the system. After approval, the locked pipeline artifact can be [exported directly to production](./direct-to-production.md).

For the pipeline in production **monitoring is essential** to maintaining the reliability, performance, and accuracy of systems in real-world scenarios. The platform **automates production monitoring** by ingesting data from relevant systems, generating performance metrics, providing intuitive monitoring dashboards and alerting capabilities. Additionally, it offers an **Annotation Queues**, enabling human reviewers to evaluate and label production data, with automated dashboards for key insights and statistics.
