## What are Flags?

These are used to Flag an Object and can be created by anyone with Write access to Settings.
An object can be flagged for any reason (e.g. `NeedShadowResultsFor2Months` or `NeedRetrainIn6Months`) by any member of any Workflow that oversees objects of the same type. Similarly, a flag can be dropped (i.e., deactivated) by anyone with the authority to add the flag.

## How to create a Flag?

- Go to **Settings** module and click on **Flags** Tab.
- Click on **Create** button on **Flags** listing page.
- Fill in important details like **Name** and **Description**.
- Lastly click on **Create** button to register the flag.

## How to activate a Flag ?

- **Go to object details page** where the already registered flag needs to be added.
- **Click on Flags** Tab.
- Click on **Attach Flag** tab.
- Select the **flag name from the drop down** in the popup and **provide a comment**.
- Lastly, click on **Submit** button to activate the flag.

> **Note:**

> - An Approver can at any time can add or remove a Flag on a given object (e.g., Pipeline).
> - Flags have restricted usage (only approvers can use them).
> - Only those with access to Settings can create Flags.
> - Multiple flags can be added to one object.

Once the flag is activated, platform would display a **Red Color** flag beside the object's name on details page.

Once the flag is attached, it cannot be removed from the object, but it can be deactivated. To deactivate a flag click on **Action -> Deactivate** and provide a deactivation comment. Red Flag would stop showing for the object as the flag is deactivated.
