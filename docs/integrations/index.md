# GGX Integrations

Corridor GGX is built with extensibility in mind and supports a wide range of integrations that allow you to seamlessly plug into existing workflows and tools.

These integrations are organized into the following categories:

1. **LLM Providers:**  
   Connect to popular foundational models from leading providers to power your generative experiences.  
   Examples: [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), [Gemini (Google)](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/), [DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com/), [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/)

2. **Agent Providers & Frameworks:**  
   Leverage pre-built agent providers or bring your own orchestration frameworks to create and manage intelligent, multi-step agent workflows with minimal setup.  
   Examples: [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai), [Salesforce Einstein](https://www.salesforce.com/products/einstein/), [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/), [Vapi AI](https://vapi.ai/)

3. **Evaluation Libraries:**  
   Plug in evaluation tools to assess your data, RAGs, pipelines, agents, etc. effectively.  
   Examples: [Cleanlab](https://cleanlab.ai/), [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas)
