As Corridor starts to understand the kind of pipeline being created, what models, prompts, etc. it is using and also starts to understand the evaluations being run on the pipeline. It becomes a great central knowledge base of all work done throughout the GenAI lifecycle.

Corridor can export all this information into various formats (like Word or PDF) to make it easy to submit documentation and audit reports external to the system.

- Automated Documentation are generated for the Prompts, Models, Pipelines in their respective Registry
- Automated Documentation for evaluations is available on the **Job Details** tab.

Simply click on the **Export** button and select the required format for the document to be downloaded
