[Corridor GenGuardX](https://ggx.corridorplatforms.com) is a Responsible AI Governance & Testing Automation Platform designed by risk managementexperts to help companies harness the benefits of GenAI.

Enabling them to move from experimentation stage to high ROI use cases which usually require strong end-to-end pipeline testing, regulatory governance and continual human in the loop monitoring.

Whether its leveraging external agents or in-house custom solutions. Corridor provides trust and comfort to facilitate
efficient @scale deployment of GenAI - agnostic of industry.

It enables the secure and compliant deployment of high-impact GenAI applications, including IVR systems, agent assist tools, and chatbots. It addresses critical challenges often overlooked by
existing tools, including robust model risk management, hallucinations, PII leakage, and fair lending bias. GGX ensures comprehensive governance through rigorous full-pipeline testing, out-of-the-box standardized evaluation metrics, regulatory compliance checks, and continuous human-in-the-loop oversight. By streamlining these processes across the LLM pipeline, GGX
empowers organizations to confidently transition from use-case experimentation to production, scaling trusted, high-ROI customer-facing solutions.

GGX offers a structured framework for **registering, refining, evaluating, approving, deploying, and monitoring** GenAI applications.
It provides:

- ✅ **Register & Refine** – A point-and-click interface for building GenAI applications, along with tools for optimizing prompts, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and pipelines.
- ✅ **Evaluate & Approve** – Standardized and customizable testing protocols, dashboards with human-in-the-loop testing, and approval tracking.
- ✅ **Deploy & Monitor** – Direct-to-production deployment with ongoing monitoring.

## Key Pillars of GGX Platform:

### 1. Centralized Governed Platform

- **Organized GenAI Studio** for registering, evaluating, and governing LLM pipelines and its components like RAG, LLMs, Prompts
- **Version tracking** with comprehensive audit nd governance capabilities
- **Flexibility** to recreate production pipelines for iterative testing and updates
- **Automated approval workflows** for direct-to-production deployment
- **Built-in Role Governance** for proper approval, access, and monitoring rights
- **Strong change management** with automated documentation of all the modifications done to an object
- **Automation of end-to-end testing and CI/CD deployment** for rapid iteration with control

### 2. Standardized MRM/FL Tests

- **Curated datasets and evaluation reports** to identify and mitigate risks like toxicity and bias
- **Controlled dashboards** for Model Risk Management (MRM) and Fair Lending (FL)
- **Human Integrated Testing (HIT)** for real-time interaction and validation
- **Annotation Queues** for labeling and performance tracking of production data

### 3. Easy Ecosystem Connect via APIs

- **Seamless connectivity** to foundational models (e.g., OpenAI's GPT, Google Gemini, Claude)
- **API integration** with banking applications for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Models etc.
- **Monitoring of conversation logs** with automated dashboards for transparency and compliance
- **Export artifact** directly to the production system
